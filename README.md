# Frontend take home exercise

## Prerequisites

To perform the test you will need a valid [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installation.
Then you need to follow those steps in order to have a valid backend for this test:
 - Clone this repository
 - Go inside the repository
 - Run the command `docker-compose up -d` in a terminal
 - If everything goes well the documentation for the backend should be [here](http://localhost:8080/documentation)


## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to provide a frontend application interacting with the API you just started.
The API provides a simple CRUD for Invoices and Companies entities, we expect your app to provide a least :
 - A way to list Invoices
 - A way to create an Invoice
 - A way to delete an Invoice
 - A way to create a Company
 - a way to sort Invoices by Company

Your app is expected to be written in ReactJS and the usage of Typescript would be apreciated.

The code must be as good as you would expect a production code to be.

There is no restrictions on libraries, feel free to use anything you find useful.
