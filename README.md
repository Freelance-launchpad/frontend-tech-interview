# Frontend test interview

## Summary

The goal of this test is to create a Next.js application by displaying data from an external API:

- Display on the homepage a data list of 10-15 items
- Have the possibility to search in this data list via a search field (a simple/exact search will be enough)
- On this homepage display randomly 2 items that change every 10 seconds
- And finally create a detail page on another URL to display the details of this item

For the API to use we suggest https://punkapi.com/ but as long as the subject is respected you can use any other API

Here is an example of the result https://jump-tech-interview.vercel.app/
