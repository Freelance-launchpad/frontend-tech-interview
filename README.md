# Frontend test interview

## Summary

The goal of this test is to create a react application (choose the framework you want, really) by displaying data from an external API.

Your deliverable is expected to have two pages.

Page One:
- Have a search field to search the api
- By default when there is no search display a message to invite the user to search
- Display the first 10 results of the search

Page Two:
- Create form with title, email and descrition fields
- Add validation on submit
- Console the json result on submit

For the API to use we suggest https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search but as long as the subject is respected you can use any other API.

### Bonus

- Use SSR
- Add animations
- Responsive
- Create a detail page of an item (with openlibrary, you can access the detail of an item with the `key` value + the `.json` extension)

## Libraries and tools you must use:

- Tanstack Query
- TailwindCss
- TypeScript
- React Hook Form with Zod

## Submission
